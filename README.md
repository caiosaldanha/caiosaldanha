# About me

Hello, I'm Caio. I'm a Data Analyst and a Data Science Student with a passion for building creative and innovative solutions in data engineering, big data analytics, and process mining. I enjoy working in collaborative environments where I can work with diverse teams to solve complex problems.

My educational journey started with studying marketing, advertising, and linguistics during my undergraduate studies, and now I'm majoring in Big Data & Analytics Management from Senac. I'm also pursuing a certificate in Data Science & Machine Learning from Tera, as I believe in continuous learning and growth to keep up with the fast-evolving field of data science.

In summary, I possess a diverse educational background that combines marketing, audio engineering (the study of sound and its production), advertising, design, and linguistics, with data analytics, allowing me to bring a unique perspective to data-driven problem-solving. I also have a passion for innovation, having participated in international events, and a collaborative mindset that enables me to work with multiple teams to develop efficient and effective solutions no matter the challenge.
