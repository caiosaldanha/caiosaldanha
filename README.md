# About me

Hello, I'm Caio. I'm a Data Scientist with a passion for building creative and innovative solutions in data engineering, big data analytics, and product design. I enjoy working in collaborative environments where I can collaborate with diverse teams to solve complex problems.

My educational journey started with studying marketing, advertising, and linguistics during my undergraduate studies, and now I'm majoring in Big Data & Analytics Management from Senac. I'm also pursuing a certificate in Data Science & Machine Learning from Tera, as I believe in continuous learning and growth to keep up with the fast-evolving field of data science.
